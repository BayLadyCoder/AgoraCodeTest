Questions and Problems I found from working on this project

1. There is no image of individual product bottle(for Free Shipping Section) provided in the Building assets.

2. Not provide text colors or sizes.  For example, red color in Perfect Blood Sugar in the Header Section

3. Not provide color gradient background for Header Text (Perfect Blood Sugar)

4. No indications for italic text (only on mockups which is not very clear)

5. There are typo in text file (example, chcolate)

6. Not provide text size (sometimes designer can be more specific)

7. No Text shadow value provided but you have it on the mockup in the Old man  sitting at the tree section

8. Two of the PNG images of Transparent Arrows are unusable (one is incompleted and one is not transparent)

9. Text in the guarantee section that is provide is a bit different from the text in the mockup photo. (There are duplicated text in the mockup photo this in part)

10. Font family provided are different than the mockup (You already indicated it on the instructor)

11.(Suggestion) Footer text(the white text below the add to cart button) could have use text-align: center to make it look better.

Thank you for your time.
